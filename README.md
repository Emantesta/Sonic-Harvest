Sonic Harvest is a decentralized finance (DeFi) yield farming aggregator optimized for the Sonic Blockchain. It maximizes yield by dynamically allocating funds across multiple protocols, including Aave V3, Compound, FlyingTulip, real-world asset (RWA) protocols, and Sonic-native DeFi protocols. Leveraging Sonic’s Fee Monetization, native USDC, RedStone oracles, and Sonic Points for airdrop eligibility, Sonic Harvest offers a secure, scalable, and user-friendly solution for yield optimization.

Overview
Sonic Harvest is a UUPS-upgradeable, ownable, pausable, and reentrancy-guarded smart contract that aggregates yield farming opportunities on the Sonic Blockchain. It supports:
Dynamic Rebalancing: Allocates funds to protocols based on real-time APY data from Chainlink/RedStone oracles.

Leveraged Yield Farming: Supports borrowing from Aave V3, Compound, and FlyingTulip with strict LTV (Loan-to-Value) and health factor checks.

Governance: Multi-sig or DAO-based governance with timelocks for upgrades, fee updates, and fund recovery.

Sonic Ecosystem Integration: Uses Sonic’s native USDC, Fee Monetization, and Sonic Points for user incentives.

Safety Mechanisms: Emergency pause, circuit breakers for oracle failures, and user blacklisting for compliance.

The contract is designed for Sonic’s Blaze testnet and is compatible with SonicVM (EVM-compatible). It aims to provide users with optimized returns while maintaining security and transparency.
Features
Supported Protocols:
Aave V3 (supply/withdraw, variable-rate borrowing).

Compound (mint/redeem, borrowing with collateral factor checks).

FlyingTulip (dynamic APY, leverage, OFAC compliance).

RWA protocols (e.g., Sigma Fund for tokenized assets).

Sonic-native DeFi protocols (via IDeFiYield interface).

Yield Optimization:
Reallocates funds to protocols with the highest APY, weighted by available liquidity.

Fetches APY data from Chainlink/RedStone oracles, Aave/Compound APIs, or Sonic protocol interfaces.

Leverage Management:
Supports up to 80% LTV for leveraged positions.

Ensures Aave health factor ≥ 1.5 and Compound collateral factor ≥ 1.5e18.

Unwinds leverage during emergency pauses.

Fee Structure:
0.5% management fee on deposits.

10% performance fee on profits.

90% of gas fees contribute to Sonic Fee Monetization rewards.

Governance and Security:
2-day timelock for upgrades, fee changes, and fund recovery.

Emergency pause (7-day max) with user withdrawal support.

Circuit breaker pauses rebalancing if >50% of oracle feeds fail.

Blacklist and OFAC compliance via FlyingTulip.

User Incentives:
Earn Sonic Points (2x for deposits/allocations, 1x for withdrawals) for airdrop eligibility.

Claimable Fee Monetization rewards for governance.

Architecture
Sonic Harvest is built using Solidity 0.8.20 and follows a modular, upgradeable design:
Key Components
Interfaces:
IAaveV3Pool: Interacts with Aave V3 for supply, withdrawal, and borrowing.

ICompound: Manages Compound cToken minting, redemption, and borrowing.

IRWAYield: Handles RWA protocol deposits and withdrawals.

IDeFiYield: Supports Sonic-native DeFi protocols.

IFlyingTulip: Provides dynamic APY, leverage, and compliance checks.

ISonicProtocol: Ensures protocol compliance and fetches Sonic-native APYs.

State Variables:
stablecoin: Sonic’s native USDC (immutable).

allocations: Tracks protocol allocations (amount, APY, leverage status).

userBalances: Records user deposits.

sonicPointsEarned: Tracks user Sonic Points for airdrop.

totalFeeMonetizationRewards: Accumulates Fee Monetization rewards.

Modifiers:
onlyGovernance: Restricts sensitive functions to the governance address.

whenNotEmergencyPaused: Prevents actions during emergency pauses.

sonicFeeMonetization: Calculates and accumulates Fee Monetization rewards.

Events:
Emits events for deposits, withdrawals, rebalancing, fee collection, governance updates, and more for transparency.

Workflow
Deposit: Users deposit USDC, pay a 0.5% management fee, and earn 2x Sonic Points. Funds are allocated to protocols based on APY.

Rebalance: Governance triggers rebalancing to optimize allocations using oracle data. Leveraged positions are adjusted if enabled.

Withdraw: Users withdraw funds, receive profits (minus 10% performance fee), and earn 1x Sonic Points.

Upkeep: Chainlink Automation updates APYs daily. Manual upkeep is available if automation fails.

Emergency: Governance can pause the contract, unwind leverage, or recover funds with a 2-day timelock.

Governance: Updates fees, governance, or whitelists protocols via timelocked actions.

await SonicHarvest.upgradeTo(newImplementation.address);

Security Considerations
Reentrancy Protection: Uses ReentrancyGuard for all external calls involving transfers.

Upgradeability: UUPS proxy with a 2-day timelock for upgrades, restricted to the owner.

Pausability: Supports emergency pause (7-day max) and regular pause/unpause by governance.

Oracle Safety:
Circuit breaker pauses rebalancing if >50% of feeds fail.

Validates APY data (0 < APY ≤ 100%) and checks for staleness (30 minutes max).

Falls back to last known APYs or Aave/Compound/Sonic APIs if oracles fail.

Compliance:
Blacklist users via updateBlacklist.

OFAC compliance checks via FlyingTulip’s isOFACCompliant.

Leverage Risks:
Caps LTV at 80%.

Ensures Aave health factor ≥ 1.5 and Compound collateral factor ≥ 1.5e18.

Unwinds leverage during pauses to mitigate liquidation risks.

Timelocks: 2-day delay for governance actions (upgrades, fee updates, fund recovery).

Audits: Recommended to undergo a formal audit by a reputable firm before mainnet deployment.

Testing
Setup
Install testing dependencies:
bash

npm install --dev mocha chai @nomiclabs/hardhat-ethers

Deploy mock contracts:
Mock Aave V3, Compound, FlyingTulip, RWAYield, DeFiYield, SonicProtocol, and USDC.

Mock RedStone/Chainlink oracles with sample APYs (e.g., 6–12%).

Fund the test environment:
Use Sonic’s testnet faucet to obtain S and USDC.

Transfer USDC to test accounts.

Test Cases
Run tests with:
bash

npx hardhat test

Core Functionality
Deposit:
Deposit 10,000 USDC, verify 0.5% fee (50 USDC), and check allocation across protocols.

Confirm 2x Sonic Points earned.

Withdraw:
Withdraw 5,000 USDC, verify profit calculation (based on 6–12% APY), 10% performance fee, and 1x Sonic Points.

Rebalance:
Simulate APY changes (e.g., FlyingTulip 8% → 12%), verify reallocation.

Test leverage inclusion when enabled.

Leverage:
Enable leverage, deposit to Aave/Compound/FlyingTulip, verify LTV ≤ 80% and health factor ≥ 1.5.

Test leverage unwinding during pause.

Governance
Fee Updates:
Propose and execute fee update (e.g., 1% management, 15% performance) after 2-day timelock.

Protocol Whitelisting:
Whitelist a new protocol, verify APY feed integration.

Fund Recovery:
Simulate protocol failure, propose and execute fund recovery after timelock.

Governance Update:
Propose and confirm new governance address after 2-day delay.

Security
Emergency Pause:
Trigger emergency pause, verify user withdrawals work, and test auto-unpause after 7 days.

Circuit Breaker:
Simulate >50% oracle feed failures, verify rebalancing pause.

Reentrancy:
Attempt reentrancy attacks on deposit/withdraw, verify protection.

Blacklist:
Blacklist a user, verify they cannot deposit.

Edge Cases
Zero Deposits: Test deposits below MIN_DEPOSIT (reverts).

Empty Protocols: Test rebalancing with no valid protocols (skips allocation).

Stale Oracles: Test with stale APY feeds, verify fallback to last known APYs.

Low Liquidity: Test withdrawals exceeding protocol liquidity, verify partial withdrawals.

Coverage
Aim for ≥95% test coverage using:
bash

npx hardhat coverage
